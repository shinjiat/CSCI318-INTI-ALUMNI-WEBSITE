# CSCI318-INTI-ALUMNI-WEBSITE
In this project, I have been assigned to implement and design the API for Admin access as well as aiding the other members on backend.

I have also customized the 404 error page(web hosting), as such that when a page was not found, a customized 404 error page will give correct directions to the user.

** Updated source codes were all deleted on my friend's hostinger account, I'm unable to get any screenshot unfortunately.

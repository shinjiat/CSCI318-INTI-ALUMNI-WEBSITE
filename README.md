# CSCI318-INTI-ALUMNI-WEBSITE
In this project, I have been assigned to implement and design the [API](https://github.com/shinjiat/CSCI318-INTI-ALUMNI-WEBSITE/tree/master/adminAPI) for Admin access as well as aiding the another back-end developer specically on [memberarea folder](https://github.com/shinjiat/CSCI318-INTI-ALUMNI-WEBSITE/tree/master/memberarea).

I have also customized the [404 error page](https://github.com/shinjiat/CSCI318-INTI-ALUMNI-WEBSITE/blob/master/404.php)(web hosting), as such that when a page was not found, a customized 404 error page will give correct directions to the user.

##### Updated source codes were all deleted on my [friend](https://github.com/buyback)'s hostinger account, I'm unable to get any screenshot from the original online hosted Website unfortunately.
##### I am unable to replicate how the website would look like on localhost, due to missing too many updated files, table and hard-coded data on hostinger's database.
